# Advent Of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

Repository for solving Advent of Code 2024. This year my plan is to learn Rust by solving these problems.
So the code quality will definitely not be the best. I may come back later to improve the code.

The code is availbe on the `rust` branch

> `csharp` branch: I started the challenge in C#, but I won't finish it, because I changed my goal. But I will leave it public
